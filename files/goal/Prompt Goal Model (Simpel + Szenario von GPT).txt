Prompt Goal Model

You are a model generator who can deliver individual models based on the given components and the syntax for describing the models .Give as an answer the created model in ADL syntax.

Goals Model Purpose:

- to describe what the enterprise and its employees want to achieve, or to avoid, and when
- to describe the goals of the enterprise along with the problems associated with achieving these goals
- to explain why, or why not, processes, rules and requirements exist or do not exist

Components:

- Goal: This component serves to articulate the aspirations and objectives related to the business or the state of its affairs that an individual or organization aims to attain. Goals can manifest as specific, measurable outcomes or broader visions and directions. They encompass various meanings such as targets, needs, requirements, or desired states. A key guideline is that goals should be expressed clearly in full sentences, typically beginning with "The goal is...". It is advisable to avoid combining multiple statements within the same modeling component. 
- Problem: This element is employed to signify situations where the environment is or could potentially deteriorate into a state unfavorable for achieving goals. Problems can be categorized into two subtypes: threats and weaknesses.
Constraint: Constraints represent external factors such as business restrictions, regulations, laws, or policies that exert influence over components and relationships within the Enterprise Model.
- Opportunity: Opportunities denote advantageous circumstances that an organization may capitalize on. When identified, an opportunity should be transformed into a specific goal.



This is the Syntax of some elements of a sample model. Learn this syntax:

This is a sample of the Header for the code syntax. A header must be displayed before the components:

VERSION <5.1>

BUSINESS PROCESS MODEL <Test 2 > : <2021_04_22_4EM-Rostock Library_87>
VERSION <2 >
TYPE <Goal Model>


From here the Components can be displayed. There are some Components given to learn the syntax of these components. The Brackets are placeholders. Further information stands within the brackets:

Now you have learned the Language for creating models.

Based on the learned Components for modeling, create a specific and very detailed model for the following Scenario in one Codesnippet:


Components:
Goal

Increase profit by 15% this year.
Subgoals

Boost sales
Reduce operating costs by 10%
Opportunity

Acquire new customers
Expand marketing activities
Develop new products
Reduce time-to-market
Expand services
Problem

Developing new products (costly and time-consuming)
Conflicting with goal of reducing costs
Threat

Insufficient adherence to shipping guidelines
Lack of machine maintenance knowledge
Weakness

Legal limits on overtime hours
Cause

Introducing a new payment system
Buying more efficient machines
Constraint

Legal limits on overtime hours
Relationships:
Goal supports Subgoals

Increase profit by 15% this year supports:
Boost sales
Reduce operating costs by 10%
Subgoals are refined by Opportunities

Boost sales is refined by:
Acquire new customers
Expand marketing activities
Reduce operating costs by 10% is refined by:
Optimize manufacturing processes
Opportunities and Problems

Developing new products (Opportunity) conflicts with:
Goal of reducing costs (Problem)
Opportunities supported by Causes

Developing new products is supported by:
Introducing a new payment system
Buying more efficient machines
Problems hinder Opportunities

Insufficient adherence to shipping guidelines hinders:
Developing new products
Expanding services
Threats hinder Subgoals

Lack of machine maintenance knowledge hinders:
Boost sales (specifically, expanding services)
Constraints on Goals and Opportunities

Legal limits on overtime hours constrain:
Subgoals (Boost sales, Reduce operating costs by 10%)
Opportunities (e.g., expanding services)
This model outlines how "Accessoires4you" aims to achieve its main goal through strategic initiatives, while managing opportunities, problems, threats, causes, and constraints that impact their success.
