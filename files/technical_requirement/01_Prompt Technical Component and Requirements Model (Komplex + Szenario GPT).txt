Technical Component and Requirement Model

You are a model generator who can deliver individual models based on the given components and the syntax for describing the models.

Technical Component and Requirement Modell Purpose:

- The purpose of the technical components and requirements model (TKAM) is to define and document the structure and properties of information systems within an enterprise context. 
- It integrates business goals and processes to specify functional and non-functional requirements for current and future IT systems. 
- TKAM facilitates the design and implementation of IT architectures that align with organizational objectives and support efficient business operations.

Components:

- Definition: Functional requirements define the desired behavior or functionality of a system or component. Technical components represent tangible parts or modules within a system that contribute to fulfilling these requirements.
- AND Relationships: Connect multiple technical components as parents in a sequence, ensuring all connected components must be completed or available before proceeding.
- OR Relationships: Link technical components where at least one must be completed or available to proceed.
- Supports: Indicates that one concept or component enhances or facilitates another.

Learn the following Syntax for the Technical Component and Requirement Modell Purpose:

This is a sample of the Header for the code syntax. A header must be displayed before the components:

///////////////////

VERSION <5.1>
BUSINESS PROCESS MODEL <Technical Components and Requirements Model - new> : <2021_04_22_4EM-Rostock Library_87>
VERSION <>
TYPE <Technical Components and Requirements Model>

From here the Components can be displayed. There are some Components given to learn the syntax of these components. The structure is INSTANCE <Name> : <Type> . 

This is a Syntax Example for the technical Component:

INSTANCE <IS Technical Component - 1> : <IS Technical Component>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:16cm y:2.5cm w:4cm h:2cm index:3"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Location>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Quantity>
	VALUE 0

	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE
//END

This is a sample of the Requirement Component:
INSTANCE <IS Requirement - 1> : <IS Requirement>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:2.5cm y:8cm w:4cm h:2cm index:4"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE "Functional"

	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE
//END

This is a sample of the AND Component:
INSTANCE <AND-18417> : <AND>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:6.5cm y:9.5cm index:5"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""
//END

This is a sample of the OR Component:
INSTANCE <OR-18420> : <OR>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:11.5cm y:11.5cm index:6"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""
//END

These are many Examples for RELATION <4EM_Relation> Components:

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <IS Technical Component - 3> : <IS Technical Component>
	TO <AND-18503> : <AND>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:5"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <IS Requirement - 3> : <IS Requirement>
	TO <AND-18503> : <AND>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:6"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <AND-18503> : <AND>
	TO <IS Technical Component - 4> : <IS Technical Component>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:7"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <AND-18509> : <AND>
	TO <IS Requirement - 4> : <IS Requirement>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:15"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <OR-18512> : <OR>
	TO <IS Requirement - 5> : <IS Requirement>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:18"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <OR-18512> : <OR>
	TO <IS Requirement - 3> : <IS Requirement>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:20"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <IS Technical Component - 5> : <IS Technical Component>
	TO <AND-18509> : <AND>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:16"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <IS Technical Component - 5> : <IS Technical Component>
	TO <OR-18512> : <OR>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:19"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <IS Technical Component - 6> : <IS Technical Component>
	TO <OR-18512> : <OR>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:17"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <IS Requirement - 5> : <IS Requirement>
	TO <AND-18509> : <AND>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:14"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

Each Component should be connected with a Relation.

Now you have learned the Language for creating models.

Based on the learned Components for modeling, create a specific and very detailed model for the following Scenario in one Code Snippet ONLY WRITE CODE, NO COMMENTARY:
