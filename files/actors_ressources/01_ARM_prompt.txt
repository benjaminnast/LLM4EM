You are a model generator who can deliver individual models based on the given components and the syntax for describing the models.


Actors and Ressources Model purpose:
- An actors and resource model is designed to represent and manage the interactions between various entities (actors) and the resources they use or affect within a system. 
- The actors and resources model utilizes the following elements to represent and manage various aspects of an organizational structure and its operations:
- The actors and resources model utilizes the following elements to represent and manage various aspects of an organizational structure and its operations:
- The actors and resources model utilizes the following elements to represent and manage various aspects of an organizational structure and its operations:


Components: 

- Individual: Represents a single person involved in the organization.
- Role: Defines the function or job description of an individual within the organization.
- Resource: Denotes the assets or tools available to individuals or roles.
- Organizational Unit: A division or department within the organization.
- Development Action: Specific tasks or activities aimed at achieving organizational goals.
- Partial Part of Relation: A component of a larger relationship within the model.
- Total Part of Relation: The complete relationship connecting different elements in the model.
- Comment: Annotations or notes providing additional context or information.
- Relational Arrow: Visual representation of relationships or interactions between elements.
- These elements collectively help in visualizing, planning, and analyzing the roles, resources, and relationships within an organization.



This is the Syntax of some elements of a sample model. Learn this syntax:


This is a sample of the Header for the code syntax. A header must be displayed before the components:

TYPE <Actors and Resources Model>


From here the Components can be displayed. There are some Components given to learn the syntax of these components. The Brackets are placeholders. Further information stands within the brackets:


This is an example of a Individual Component:


INSTANCE <Individual - 1> : <Individual>


	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:9cm y:3cm w:4cm h:2cm index:1"


	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE


	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE


// END


This is an Example for a Role Component:


INSTANCE <Role - 1> : <Role>


	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:4cm y:6.5cm w:4cm h:2cm index:2"


	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE


	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Qualification>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Number of Employees with this Role>
	VALUE 0


	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE


// END


This is an Example for an Ressource Component:
INSTANCE <Resource - 1> : <Resource>


	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:11.5cm y:6.5cm w:4cm h:2cm index:3"


	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE


	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Location>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Quantity>
	VALUE 0


	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE




//END


This is an Example for an Organizational Unit:
INSTANCE <Organizational Unit - 1> : <Organizational Unit>


	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:3cm y:10.5cm w:4cm h:2cm index:4"


	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE


	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Location>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE


//END


The following Components are Examples of partial and total Is A Relations
INSTANCE <Partial-ISA-14615> : <Partial-ISA>


	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:9.5cm y:10.5cm index:5"


	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""




INSTANCE <Total-ISA-14618> : <Total-ISA>


	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:14cm y:10.5cm index:6"


	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""




INSTANCE <Partial-PartOF-14621> : <Partial-PartOF>


	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:2.5cm y:13cm index:7"


	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""




INSTANCE <Total-PartOF-14624> : <Total-PartOF>


	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:7cm y:13cm index:8"


	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""
//END


These are many Examples for RELATION <4EM_Relation> Components:
RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <Individual - 1> : <Individual>
	TO <Resource - 1> : <Resource>


	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:4"


	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END


RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <Individual - 1> : <Individual>
	TO <Role - 1> : <Role>


	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:5"


	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE "play"


	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END


RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <Organizational Unit - 2> : <Organizational Unit>
	TO <Individual - 1> : <Individual>


	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:7"


	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""


	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""
//END

Each Component should be connected with a Relation.
Now you learned the Language for creating models.

Based on the learned Components for modeling, create a specific and very detailed model for the following Scenario in one Code Snippet ONLY WRITE CODE, NO COMMENTARY:
