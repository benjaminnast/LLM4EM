Prompt Concept Model

You are a model generator who can deliver individual models based on the given components and the syntax for describing the models. Give as an answer the created model in ADL syntax. 


Concept Model purpose:

-To specify concepts, terms, and entities used across various submodels but not defined within them.
- To ensure a uniform understanding and usage of these concepts, terms, and entities across different submodels.
- To describe technical terms, input and output information of processes, and processed materials relevant to the modeling purpose.
- To include both physical objects (e.g., products) and intangible concepts (e.g., quality) necessary for understanding information and material flows in business processes.
- To provide a consistent definition for concepts used by all modeling participants and stakeholders, akin to a glossary for the elements of a business model.


Components: 
Concept: Concepts within the business rule model encapsulate the essence of terms or entities essential for modeling purposes, representing pertinent information.
Attribute: Attributes characterize the properties of a concept, describing its qualities comprehensively within the context of the model.
Normal Relationships: These connections facilitate linking two or more distinct elements within the model. For instance, a relationship may connect a concept with an attribute, establishing their interdependence.
Binary Relationships: This type of relationship exists exclusively between two concepts, defined by a designated connection name. Binary relationships are inherently bidirectional, featuring a primary direction indicated by an arrow, with the inverse direction also specified. They are categorized into three types: 1:1, 1:n, m:n
IS_A Relationship: This relationship signifies specialization or generalization between concepts. In this structure, <B> represents the broader concept while <A> is its specialized counterpart, inheriting attributes, values, and integrity constraints.
PART_OF Relationship: The PART_OF relationship defines the composition of a concept within other concepts. Here, <B> encompasses both <A> and <C>, refining them within its aggregation. This relationship, also known as aggregation or composition, outlines hierarchical levels of refinement.

From here the Components can be displayed. There are some Components given to learn the syntax of these components. The Brackets are placeholders. Further information stands within the brackets:

This is an Example of an Concept Component:

 INSTANCE <Concept - 1> : <Concept>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:5cm y:3cm w:5cm h:1.8cm index:1"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Complexity>
	VALUE 0

	ATTRIBUTE <Execution Time>
	VALUE 0

	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE

//END

This is an Example of a Attribute Component:

INSTANCE <Attribute - 1> : <Attribute>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:7cm y:9cm w:5cm h:1.2cm index:2"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Data Type>
	VALUE "String"

	ATTRIBUTE <Value Range>
	VALUE ""

//END

This is an Example of a Partial-PartOF Component: 

INSTANCE <Partial-PartOF-15326> : <Partial-PartOF>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:7cm y:6.5cm index:4"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

//END

This is an Example of a Partial-ISA Component:

INSTANCE <Partial-ISA-15332> : <Partial-ISA>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:8cm y:19.5cm index:8"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

//END

This is a Example of a TOTAL-ISA Component: 

INSTANCE <Total-ISA-15347> : <Total-ISA>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:20cm y:19.5cm index:15"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

//END

This is a Example of Total-PartOF Component: 

INSTANCE <Total-PartOF-15350> : <Total-PartOF>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:20.5cm y:6cm index:16"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

//END

These are many Examples for RELATION <4EM_Relation> Components:

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <Attribute - 1> : <Attribute>
	TO <Partial-PartOF-15326> : <Partial-PartOF>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:5"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

//END

This i an Example of a 1:n Relation:

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <Concept - 1> : <Concept>
	TO <Concept - 4> : <Concept>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:29"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE "1:n"

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

//END

This is a Example of a 1:1 Relation: 

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <Concept - 2> : <Concept>
	TO <Concept - 1> : <Concept>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:30"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE "1:1"

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

//END

This is a Example of a n:m Relation: 

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <Concept - 3> : <Concept>
	TO <Concept - 2> : <Concept>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:31"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE "n:m"

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

//END
