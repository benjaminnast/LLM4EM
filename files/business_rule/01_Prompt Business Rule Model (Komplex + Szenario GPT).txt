Prompt Business Rule Model

You are a model generator who can deliver individual models based on the given components and the syntax for describing the models. Give as an answer the created model in ADL syntax. 


Business Rule Model Purpose:
- The Business Rule Model serves as a framework for operationalizing enterprise goals within the context of the 4EM model.
- It defines operational actions and framework conditions necessary to achieve specified goals and adhere to external regulations.

This model categorizes business rules into two types:
- Precise Regulation: Specifies detailed measures and decisions required to achieve specific objectives.
External Rules: Documents external regulations and the corresponding compliance measures that bind the organization.
- Business rules within this model establish a hierarchical structure, where lower-level rules elucidate higher-level goals or rules, thereby integrating closely with goal modeling.
- By operationalizing goals, business rules directly influence company actions and business processes, potentially triggering workflows and referencing concepts detailed in the concept model.
- Moreover, business rules may drive specific functionalities within information systems, thereby motivating components in technical component and requirement models.
- Ultimately, the Business Rule Model ensures that organizational decisions and actions are aligned with strategic goals and regulatory requirements, fostering consistency and compliance across operations.


The business rule model utilizes the following elements to represent and manage various aspects of an organizational structure and its operations:

- Derivation rules: Derivation rules (derivation) are expressions that specify how information or decisions should be derived from other information.
- Event-action rules: Event-action rules specify which activities are to be carried out when a defined event occurs.
- Constraint Rules:  Rules for maintaining the integrity of components (also integrity rules), can be Transition or Static.
- Supportive relations: Supportive relations are called vertical or hierarchical connections viewed. This type is used to refine business rules and disassemble. 
- Hindering relations: Hindering relations describe the exact opposite of supportive relationships. There are negative influences between components of the control model Relation set.
- AND connector: An AND connector connects a set of different sub rules through relations, all of which are necessary to support the original refined rule. 
- OR connector: An OR connector represents a set of alternative sub-rules. In order to support the higher-level rule, it is sufficient if only a partial rule is fulfilled.

From here the Components can be displayed. There are some Components given to learn the syntax of these components. The Brackets are placeholders. Further information stands within the brackets:

This is an Example for a Transition Constraint Rule:

INSTANCE <Rule - 1> : <Rule>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:3.5cm y:4cm w:4cm h:1.5cm index:1"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE "Transition Constraint Rule"

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Formal description in advanced language>
	VALUE ""

//END

This is an Example for a Derivation Rule: 

INSTANCE <Rule - 2> : <Rule>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:11cm y:3.5cm w:4cm h:1.5cm index:8"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE "Derivation Rule"

	ATTRIBUTE <Description>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Decomposition>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Attributes>
	VALUE

	ATTRIBUTE <Formal description in advanced language>
	VALUE ""

//END

This is an Example for a Static Constraint Rule: 

INSTANCE <Rule - 3> : <Rule>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:18cm y:5.5cm w:4cm h:1.5cm index:10"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
	VALUE "Static Constraint Rule"

	ATTRIBUTE <Intermodel-Relations>
	VALUE

This is an Example for a Event-action Rule: 

INSTANCE <Rule - 4> : <Rule>

	ATTRIBUTE <Position>
	VALUE "NODE x:3cm y:8.5cm w:4cm h:1.5cm index:12"

	ATTRIBUTE <External tool coupling>
	VALUE ""

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>

These are many Examples for RELATION <4EM_Relation> Components:

RELATION <4EM_Relation>
	FROM <Rule - 1> : <Rule>

	ATTRIBUTE <Positions>
	VALUE "EDGE 0 index:9"

	ATTRIBUTE <Type>
