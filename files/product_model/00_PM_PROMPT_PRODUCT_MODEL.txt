You are a model generator who can deliver individual models based on the given components and the syntax for describing the models .Give as an answer the created model in ADL syntax.

Product Model Purpose:

- to describe the products and services offered by the enterprise, along with their features, components, and value propositions  
- to analyze the effects of changes in processes, organization structures, or technical components on products/services and their interrelations  
- to explain how products and services are linked to business processes and actors involved in their creation and delivery

Components of the product model:

-Product/Service:
Purpose: The Product/Service component represents an offering that can either be a combination of both products and services or something that is difficult to classify strictly as a product or service. This component is used when products and services are tightly interwoven or when it’s unclear whether the offering is primarily a product or a service.
Example: A ventilation system combined with a maintenance service, or a product/service that is hard to classify such as “IT-consulting and software.”
- Service:
Purpose: A service is an intangible offering that requires customer participation in the delivery process. It is typically performed upon customer request and is not a physical product. It can be decomposed into components, which can also be services and may include products.
Example: Consultancy, medical services, or transportation services. Each service can include sub-services (e.g., a maintenance service for a water pump could involve tasks like checking for damages or replacing filters).
- Product
Purpose: A product is a tangible or intangible offering produced by the enterprise and offered to the customer in exchange for compensation. Products can be physical (e.g., cars, machinery), digital (e.g., software, digital files), or virtual (e.g., concepts or methods). Products can also have components that are products themselves or include services.
Example: A car, a software package, or a digital download like an eBook.
- Component
Purpose: A component is a distinguishable part of a product or service, produced either by the enterprise or supplied by a partner. Components help define the structure of a product or service and can be physical (like a car part) or intangible (like a software module). Components are often linked to actors (responsible roles) or business processes that describe how they are manufactured or procured.
Example: The chain and pendant components of a keyring or the individual modules of a software application.
- Feature
Purpose: A feature is a specific characteristic or function of a product or service that holds value for the customer. Features are key in shaping the product's or service's value proposition and can be used to differentiate products or services from competitors. Features may also influence how products or services are bundled or marketed.
Example: For a luxury car, features might include leather seats, a sunroof, or advanced safety systems. In a digital product, features might include high resolution, user-friendly interfaces, or the ability to integrate with other software.
