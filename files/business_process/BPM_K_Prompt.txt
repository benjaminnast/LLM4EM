Prompt Business Process Model

You are a model generator who can deliver individual models based on the given components and the syntax for describing the models. Give as an answer the created model in ADL syntax. 

Business Process Model Purpose:
- The Business Process Model serves as a comprehensive framework for defining and optimizing the operational activities within an organization.
- It outlines the company’s processes, their interdependencies, and the crucial information and material flows necessary for efficient service delivery.

Types of Processes: This model categorizes processes into primary, supporting, and management categories.
-Primary Processes: These directly contribute to achieving organizational goals by delivering core products or services.
- Supporting Processes: They bolster primary processes, enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness.
- Management Processes: These govern and oversee organizational activities to ensure smooth operations and compliance.
- Strategic Alignment: Processes are defined and refined based on components of the target model, as they are instrumental in implementing and achieving the company’s strategic objectives.

- Detailed Representation: The model provides a detailed depiction of activities and their interconnections across the organization, promoting clarity and understanding.
- Forward-Looking Approach: Depending on the project scope, processes may be depicted as existing, planned, or projected for future implementation, aligning with future organizational goals.
- Hierarchical Structure: Processes are structured hierarchically, with sub-processes breaking down activities into manageable components, facilitating comprehensive modeling and operational clarity.



The Business Process model utilizes the following elements to represent and manage various aspects of an organizational structure and its operations:


- Business process: A business process describes a connected one Process of internal company activities that contribute to achieving corporate goals using company resources. Business processes are a collection of activities that have the following properties:
- Input and output variables (input and output) of a process are always materials and/or information
- Processes are controlled by rules that control how the inputs are processed and
the outputs are produced
- Processes have relationships to the actor and resource model to document the executing actors and responsibilities for a process
- A business process uses a limited amount of resources and time once this
has been initialized

External process: An external process describes a connected one Process of extra-company activities that lead to the achievement of a specific goal. External processes are a collection of activities that have the following properties:
- The activities are outside the organizational scope of the company
carried out
- The activities communicate externally with processes and other activities of the
corporate
- The activities are documented because they contribute to the provision of services
company's performance or clarity about the type of implementation can be achieved must

Information Flow and Material Flow:

Definition: Defined sets of information or materials transferred between processes.
Types:
Information Flow: Exchange of data between processes.
Material Flow: Movement of physical resources between processes.
Modeled using relationships between process components.
Flow Relation:

Definition: Describes how information or material flows relate to process components.
Representation: Solid black line with directional arrows indicating flow direction.
Example: <IK1> “is_Input” for <P1> and <P1> “has_Result” <IK2>.
AND Connector:

Definition: Connects multiple business processes in a sequence.
Function: Ensures all incoming processes must complete before the outgoing process starts (or vice versa).
Representation: Unfilled (white) circle linking flow sequences.
OR Connector:

Definition: Links multiple business processes where at least one must complete for the outgoing process to start (or vice versa).
Representation: Meeting of several flow relations (arrows).
Function: Allows flexibility by requiring completion of at least one incoming process before proceeding.
