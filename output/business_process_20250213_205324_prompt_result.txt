You are a model generator who can deliver individual models based on the given components and the syntax for describing the models. Give as an answer the created model in ADL syntax. 

Business Process Model Purpose:
- The Business Process Model serves as a comprehensive framework for defining and optimizing the operational activities within an organization.
- It outlines the company’s processes, their interdependencies, and the crucial information and material flows necessary for efficient service delivery.

Types of Processes: This model categorizes processes into primary, supporting, and management categories.
-Primary Processes: These directly contribute to achieving organizational goals by delivering core products or services.
- Supporting Processes: They bolster primary processes, enhancing their efficiency and effectiveness.
- Management Processes: These govern and oversee organizational activities to ensure smooth operations and compliance.
- Strategic Alignment: Processes are defined and refined based on components of the target model, as they are instrumental in implementing and achieving the company’s strategic objectives.

- Detailed Representation: The model provides a detailed depiction of activities and their interconnections across the organization, promoting clarity and understanding.
- Forward-Looking Approach: Depending on the project scope, processes may be depicted as existing, planned, or projected for future implementation, aligning with future organizational goals.
- Hierarchical Structure: Processes are structured hierarchically, with sub-processes breaking down activities into manageable components, facilitating comprehensive modeling and operational clarity.



The Business Process model utilizes the following elements to represent and manage various aspects of an organizational structure and its operations:


- Business process: A business process describes a connected one Process of internal company activities that contribute to achieving corporate goals using company resources. Business processes are a collection of activities that have the following properties:
- Input and output variables (input and output) of a process are always materials and/or information
- Processes are controlled by rules that control how the inputs are processed and
the outputs are produced
- Processes have relationships to the actor and resource model to document the executing actors and responsibilities for a process
- A business process uses a limited amount of resources and time once this
has been initialized

External process: An external process describes a connected one Process of extra-company activities that lead to the achievement of a specific goal. External processes are a collection of activities that have the following properties:
- The activities are outside the organizational scope of the company
carried out
- The activities communicate externally with processes and other activities of the
corporate
- The activities are documented because they contribute to the provision of services
company's performance or clarity about the type of implementation can be achieved must

Information Flow and Material Flow:

Definition: Defined sets of information or materials transferred between processes.
Types:
Information Flow: Exchange of data between processes.
Material Flow: Movement of physical resources between processes.
Modeled using relationships between process components.
Flow Relation:

Definition: Describes how information or material flows relate to process components.
Representation: Solid black line with directional arrows indicating flow direction.
Example: <IK1> “is_Input” for <P1> and <P1> “has_Result” <IK2>.
AND Connector:

Definition: Connects multiple business processes in a sequence.
Function: Ensures all incoming processes must complete before the outgoing process starts (or vice versa).
Representation: Unfilled (white) circle linking flow sequences.
OR Connector:

Definition: Links multiple business processes where at least one must complete for the outgoing process to start (or vice versa).
Representation: Meeting of several flow relations (arrows).
Function: Allows flexibility by requiring completion of at least one incoming process before proceeding.

Based on the learned Components for modeling, create a specific and very detailed model for the following Scenario:
To create a Business Process Model (BPM) for Organization ABC, we will outline the components and relationships involved in the product innovation process for the heat pumps, specifically the “Smart-Heat” product. The goal is to streamline operational efficiency while achieving the objective of an energy-efficient product.

### List of Components and Relationships

1. **Primary Processes**
   - **Product Innovation Process**
     - Sub-Process: Target Setting
     - Sub-Process: Define Product Specification

2. **Secondary Processes**
   - **Customer Survey Collection**
   - **Market Research**

3. **Management Processes**
   - **Performance Monitoring**
   - **Product Management**
   - **Resource Allocation**

4. **External Processes**
   - **Customer Feedback Analysis**
   - **Regulatory Compliance**

5. **Inputs and Outputs**
   - **Input for Target Setting**
     - Customer Survey (Input)
   - **Output from Target Setting**
     - Target Feature List (Output)
   - **Input for Define Product Specification**
     - Target Feature List (Input)
   - **Output from Define Product Specification**
     - Specification Document (Output)

6. **Actors**
   - **Product Owner** (Responsible for Target Setting and Define Product Specification)
   - **Product Development Department**
   - **Marketing Team** (for Customer Survey Collection)
   - **Technical Team** (for Production System and Version Management Support)

7. **Resources**
   - **Production System** (Supports the product fabrication)
   - **Version Management System** (Supports and tracks product specifications)
   - **Customer Survey Tools** (Used for collecting customer expectations)

8. **Control Flows**
   - Sequence from **Customer Survey** (Input) → **Target Setting** → **Target Feature List** (Output)
   - Sequence from **Target Feature List** → **Define Product Specification** → **Specification Document** (Output)

9. **Connectors**
   - **AND Connectors**
     - Connecting the Target Setting and Define Product Specification processes, as both need to be completed for the innovation process to advance.
   - **OR Connectors**
     - Possible branching for other features from market research or alternative feedback sources leading into Target Setting or specification streams.

10. **Flow Relationships**
    - Movement of information:
      - From **Customer Survey** to **Target Setting** and subsequently to **Target Feature List**.
      - From **Target Feature List** to **Define Product Specification** leading to the **Specification Document**.
    - Indicating connections between processes and how information or materials flow.

### Example BPMN Notation Elements

- **Processes**: Rectangles for each process/sub-process.
- **Events**: Circles to denote the start/end of each subprocess.
- **Connectors**: Arrows to represent control flows and connectors (AND/OR).
- **Data Objects**: Documents or other artifacts to illustrate Outputs (e.g., Target Feature List, Specification Document).
- **Actors**: Swimlanes for different roles, indicating responsibilities of different team members.

### Conclusion

This business process model provides a structured approach to understanding the product innovation process of the “Smart-Heat” heat pump, highlighting the key components, their relationships, and the flow of information and materials necessary for achieving the organization's goal of creating an energy-efficient heating solution. This organized representation can facilitate better communication, efficiency, and strategic planning within Organization ABC.
Here is the Business Process Model (BPM) for Organization ABC, representing the product innovation process for the "Smart-Heat" product in ADL syntax:
