I am trying to capture the business processes of a Organization using a Business Process Model as follows: it includes concepts of "Primary Processes", "Secondary Processes", "Management Processes", and "External Processes". Each process involves "Inputs" and "Outputs", with responsibilities assigned to "Actors" and resources identified as "Resources". Processes are sequenced using "Control Flows", which can be connected using "AND Connectors " and "OR Connectors ". Flow relationships indicate the movement of information or materials between processes.Produce a BPM for Organization ABC that aims to streamline its operational efficiency. The model should illustrate the flow of information and materials between processes and their temporal sequences. Create a List of all Components and Relationships for the following Scenario:

Scenario version 1: minimal
Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. The problem that hinders reaching this goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high.  
In the company, the role of the product owner for the heat pump “Smart-Heat” is responsible for the product innovation process and also has the responsibility for reaching the goal of the most energy-efficient heating solution. The product owner is part of the product development department.
The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process.
The technical components supporting the product innovation process are the production system and the version management system. The version management system supports the production system.
The “Smart-Heat” product consists of two components: the indoor module and the outdoor module. Smart-Heat has the feature of being energy-efficient.
Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: is defining the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product



To create a Business Process Model (BPM) for Organization ABC, we will outline the components and relationships involved in the product innovation process for the heat pumps, specifically the “Smart-Heat” product. The goal is to streamline operational efficiency while achieving the objective of an energy-efficient product.

### List of Components and Relationships

1. **Primary Processes**
   - **Product Innovation Process**
     - Sub-Process: Target Setting
     - Sub-Process: Define Product Specification

2. **Secondary Processes**
   - **Customer Survey Collection**
   - **Market Research**

3. **Management Processes**
   - **Performance Monitoring**
   - **Product Management**
   - **Resource Allocation**

4. **External Processes**
   - **Customer Feedback Analysis**
   - **Regulatory Compliance**

5. **Inputs and Outputs**
   - **Input for Target Setting**
     - Customer Survey (Input)
   - **Output from Target Setting**
     - Target Feature List (Output)
   - **Input for Define Product Specification**
     - Target Feature List (Input)
   - **Output from Define Product Specification**
     - Specification Document (Output)

6. **Actors**
   - **Product Owner** (Responsible for Target Setting and Define Product Specification)
   - **Product Development Department**
   - **Marketing Team** (for Customer Survey Collection)
   - **Technical Team** (for Production System and Version Management Support)

7. **Resources**
   - **Production System** (Supports the product fabrication)
   - **Version Management System** (Supports and tracks product specifications)
   - **Customer Survey Tools** (Used for collecting customer expectations)

8. **Control Flows**
   - Sequence from **Customer Survey** (Input) → **Target Setting** → **Target Feature List** (Output)
   - Sequence from **Target Feature List** → **Define Product Specification** → **Specification Document** (Output)

9. **Connectors**
   - **AND Connectors**
     - Connecting the Target Setting and Define Product Specification processes, as both need to be completed for the innovation process to advance.
   - **OR Connectors**
     - Possible branching for other features from market research or alternative feedback sources leading into Target Setting or specification streams.

10. **Flow Relationships**
    - Movement of information:
      - From **Customer Survey** to **Target Setting** and subsequently to **Target Feature List**.
      - From **Target Feature List** to **Define Product Specification** leading to the **Specification Document**.
    - Indicating connections between processes and how information or materials flow.

### Example BPMN Notation Elements

- **Processes**: Rectangles for each process/sub-process.
- **Events**: Circles to denote the start/end of each subprocess.
- **Connectors**: Arrows to represent control flows and connectors (AND/OR).
- **Data Objects**: Documents or other artifacts to illustrate Outputs (e.g., Target Feature List, Specification Document).
- **Actors**: Swimlanes for different roles, indicating responsibilities of different team members.

### Conclusion

This business process model provides a structured approach to understanding the product innovation process of the “Smart-Heat” heat pump, highlighting the key components, their relationships, and the flow of information and materials necessary for achieving the organization's goal of creating an energy-efficient heating solution. This organized representation can facilitate better communication, efficiency, and strategic planning within Organization ABC.
