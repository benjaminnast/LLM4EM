I am trying to capture an information technology system and its requirements of an organization using a Technical component and requirements model as follows: it has concepts of: “functional requirements”,”non functional requirement”,”concept”, “technical Component” . Technical Components can be connected with other Technical Components as a parent using "AND" and "OR" Components for the relationships. All concepts may have binary relationships with other concepts of the type “hinders”, “supports”. Create a List of all Components and Relationships for the following Scenario:
Scenario version 1: minimal
Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. The problem that hinders reaching this goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high.  
In the company, the role of the product owner for the heat pump “Smart-Heat” is responsible for the product innovation process and also has the responsibility for reaching the goal of the most energy-efficient heating solution. The product owner is part of the product development department.
The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process.
The technical components supporting the product innovation process are the production system and the version management system. The version management system supports the production system.
The “Smart-Heat” product consists of two components: the indoor module and the outdoor module. Smart-Heat has the feature of being energy-efficient.
Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: is defining the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product



Based on the provided scenario, here is a structured list of components and relationships for the Technical Component and Requirements Model:

### Components

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - Requirement 1: High energy efficiency
   - Requirement 2: Customer expectations based on survey results

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - Requirement 1: Minimization of energy consumption (measured in kWh/year)
   - Requirement 2: Ease of maintenance for the indoor and outdoor modules

3. **Concepts**
   - Energy-Efficiency
   - Energy Consumption
   - Customer Survey
   - Feature
   - Target Feature
   - Specification Document

4. **Technical Components**
   - Smart-Heat (Product)
     - Indoor Module
     - Outdoor Module
   - Production System
   - Version Management System

5. **Sub-processes in Product Innovation**
   - Target Setting
   - Product Specification

### Relationships

1. **Functional Requirements**
   - *Hinders*: Energy Consumption (hinders achieving goal of energy efficiency)
   - *Supports*: High Energy Efficiency (functional requirement supports energy-efficient design)

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
   - *Supports*: Energy-Efficiency (non-functional requirement supports the goal of high energy efficiency)

3. **Technical Components**
   - *AND Relationship*: Smart-Heat requires both Indoor Module and Outdoor Module to function.
   - *Supports*: Version Management System supports Production System (ensures efficient development and tracking of product versions)
   - *Hinders*: High energy consumption hinders the energy efficiency of Smart-Heat.

4. **Concepts**
   - Customer Survey *supports* Target Feature (customer expectations inform the feature development)
   - Target Feature *supports* Product Specification (target features help define the requirements in the specification document)

5. **Processes**
   - Target Setting *produces*: Target Feature List (output)
   - Target Feature List *input to*: Product Specification (process relies on features defined in target setting)

6. **Specification Document**
   - *Defines*: Functional and Non-Functional Requirements (captures what constitutes energy efficiency and target features)

### Summary of Relationships

- **AND Relationships**:
   - Smart-Heat = Indoor Module AND Outdoor Module
   - Production System AND Version Management System (for overarching product development support)

- **OR Relationships**:
   (not explicitly applicable in this scenario, but could represent alternative components or features that can be chosen)

- **Hinders Relationships**:
   - High energy consumption *hinders* achieving the energy-efficient goal.

- **Supports Relationships**:
   - Customer Survey *supports* the identification of Target Features.
   - Target Features *support* the creation of the Specification Document.
   - Version Management System *supports* the Production System.

This structured approach effectively captures the components and relationships, showing how they relate to the organization’s goal of developing an energy-efficient heating solution through the Smart-Heat product.
