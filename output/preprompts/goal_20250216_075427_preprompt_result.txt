I am trying to capture vision and strategy of an organization using a goal model (GM) as follows: it has concepts of "Goal", "Opportunity", "Problem" (i.e., "Threat" and "Weakness"), "Cause", and "Constraint". Goals are refined by subgoals and they are connected with its parent goal using "AND" and "OR" relationships. All concepts may have binary relationships with other concepts of the type "supports" and "hinders". Please be less verbose and detailed outcome. Create a List of all Components and Relationships for the following Scenario:
Scenario version 1: minimal
Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. The problem that hinders reaching this goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high.  
In the company, the role of the product owner for the heat pump “Smart-Heat” is responsible for the product innovation process and also has the responsibility for reaching the goal of the most energy-efficient heating solution. The product owner is part of the product development department.
The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process.
The technical components supporting the product innovation process are the production system and the version management system. The version management system supports the production system.
The “Smart-Heat” product consists of two components: the indoor module and the outdoor module. Smart-Heat has the feature of being energy-efficient.
Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: is defining the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product



### List of Components and Relationships

#### Components:
1. **Goal**: Provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market.
2. **Subgoal**: Improve energy efficiency of Smart-Heat.
3. **Problem**: Energy consumption of current product version is too high.
4. **Opportunity**: Enhance product features based on customer feedback.
5. **Constraint**: Must meet production cost targets.
6. **Cause**: High energy consumption due to current technology.
7. **Product Owner**: Responsible for product innovation for Smart-Heat.
8. **Product Development Department**: Department responsible for product innovation.
9. **Target Setting Process**: Sub-process for defining target features.
10. **Product Specification Process**: Sub-process for defining product specifications.
11. **Customer Survey**: Input source summarizing customer expectations.
12. **Target Feature List**: Output list from target setting process.
13. **Specification Document**: Output from product specification process.
14. **Production System**: Technical component supporting product innovation.
15. **Version Management System**: Technical component that supports production system.
16. **Smart-Heat**: Product consisting of an indoor module and outdoor module.
17. **Indoor Module**: Component of Smart-Heat.
18. **Outdoor Module**: Component of Smart-Heat.
19. **Feature**: Characteristic of the product visible to the customer.
20. **Energy Efficiency**: Measurement of output vs. consumption.

#### Relationships:
1. **Goal to Subgoal**: 
   - "AND" relationship between the goal and subgoal: Improve energy efficiency.
2. **Goal to Problem**: 
   - "Hinders" relationship: Energy consumption is too high hinders achieving the goal.
3. **Problem to Cause**: 
   - "Causes" relationship: High energy consumption due to current technology.
4. **Opportunity to Target Setting Process**: 
   - "Supports" relationship: Customer feedback provides opportunities for innovation.
5. **Target Setting Process to Target Feature List**:
   - Produces output (Target Feature List) from input (Customer Survey).
6. **Product Specification Process to Specification Document**:
   - Produces output (Specification Document) from input (Target Feature List).
7. **Version Management System to Production System**:
   - "Supports" relationship: Version management system supports production system.
8. **Smart-Heat to Indoor Module**:
   - "Composed of" relationship: Smart-Heat includes indoor module.
9. **Smart-Heat to Outdoor Module**:
   - "Composed of" relationship: Smart-Heat includes outdoor module.
10. **Smart-Heat to Energy Efficiency**:
    - Has feature: Energy-efficiency is a feature of Smart-Heat.
11. **Feature to Target Feature**:
    - "Supports" relationship: Target features are specific types of features for the next version. 

This compact representation captures the essential elements and relationships of your goal model for the organization.
