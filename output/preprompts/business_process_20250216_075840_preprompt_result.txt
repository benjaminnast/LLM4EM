I am trying to capture the business processes of a Organization using a Business Process Model as follows: it includes concepts of "Primary Processes", "Secondary Processes", "Management Processes", and "External Processes". Each process involves "Inputs" and "Outputs", with responsibilities assigned to "Actors" and resources identified as "Resources". Processes are sequenced using "Control Flows", which can be connected using "AND Connectors " and "OR Connectors ". Flow relationships indicate the movement of information or materials between processes.Produce a BPM for Organization ABC that aims to streamline its operational efficiency. The model should illustrate the flow of information and materials between processes and their temporal sequences. Create a List of all Components and Relationships for the following Scenario:

Scenario version 1: minimal
Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. The problem that hinders reaching this goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high.  
In the company, the role of the product owner for the heat pump “Smart-Heat” is responsible for the product innovation process and also has the responsibility for reaching the goal of the most energy-efficient heating solution. The product owner is part of the product development department.
The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process.
The technical components supporting the product innovation process are the production system and the version management system. The version management system supports the production system.
The “Smart-Heat” product consists of two components: the indoor module and the outdoor module. Smart-Heat has the feature of being energy-efficient.
Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: is defining the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product



To create a Business Process Model (BPM) for Organization ABC, which focuses on the development of the "Smart-Heat" heat pump, we can structure the process components according to the defined hierarchy of processes. Below is the BPM breakdown based on the outlined scenario, including all the recommended components and their relationships.

### BPM Components and Relationships

#### Process Categories
1. **Primary Processes**
   - Product Innovation Process

2. **Secondary Processes**
   - Customer Feedback Collection
   - Requirement Analysis
   - Product Development

3. **Management Processes**
   - Product Management
   - Resource Planning

4. **External Processes**
   - Market Analysis
   - Regulatory Compliance

---

#### Inputs & Outputs
- **Inputs**
  - Customer Survey (Input for Target Setting)
  - Target Feature List (Input for Product Specification)

- **Outputs**
  - List of Target Features (Output of Target Setting)
  - Specification Document (Output of Product Specification)

---

#### Actors
- **Product Owner** (Responsible for the entire Product Innovation Process)
- **Product Development Team** (Involved in Product Development)
- **Market Analyst** (Conducts Market Analysis)

---

#### Resources
- Production System (Supports production)
- Version Management System (Supports the development and management of product versions)
  
---

#### Control Flows & Connectors
1. **Control Flows**
   - From **Customer Survey** to **Target Setting**: Input for defining features.
   - From **Target Setting** to **List of Target Features**: Generation of features.
   - From **List of Target Features** to **Product Specification**: Input for defining product specs.
   - From **Product Specification** to **Specification Document**: Output of defined specs.

2. **Flow Relationships** (denote movement of information/materials)
   - Target setting must occur before defining the product specification.
   - The Production System and Version Management System connect to the Product Development phase to ensure alignment and coherence in production.

---

#### Temporal Sequence of Processes
1. **Start**: Customer feedback collected via the **Customer Survey**.
2. **Process 1**: **Target Setting** (execute by Product Owner)
   - Input: Customer Survey
   - Output: List of Target Features
3. **Process 2**: **Product Specification** (execute by Product Owner)
   - Input: List of Target Features
   - Output: Specification Document
4. **End**: Specification Document is completed and utilized in further product development and manufacturing processes.

### BPM Visualization
The BPM can be visually represented as a flowchart diagram, illustrating the relationships and sequences indicated above, including the connections between processes while highlighting the roles and relevant resources.

### Summary of Components
1. **Processes**
   - Primary: Product Innovation Process
   - Secondary: Customer Feedback Collection, Requirement Analysis, Product Development
   - Management: Product Management, Resource Planning
   - External: Market Analysis, Regulatory Compliance
2. **Inputs and Outputs**
   - Inputs: Customer Survey, Target Feature List
   - Outputs: List of Target Features, Specification Document
3. **Actors**: Product Owner, Product Development Team, Market Analyst
4. **Resources**: Production System, Version Management System
5. **Control Flows**: Sequential links between processes and tasks
6. **Connectors**: AND and OR connectors, if applicable to branched activities

This structured approach aims to simplify and streamline the operational processes of Organization ABC, ultimately facilitating a pathway toward developing energy-efficient heat pumps that meet market expectations.
