I am trying to capture the business processes of a Organization using a Business Process Model as follows: it includes concepts of "Primary Processes", "Secondary Processes", "Management Processes", and "External Processes". Each process involves "Inputs" and "Outputs", with responsibilities assigned to "Actors" and resources identified as "Resources". Processes are sequenced using "Control Flows", which can be connected using "AND Connectors " and "OR Connectors ". Flow relationships indicate the movement of information or materials between processes.Produce a BPM for Organization ABC that aims to streamline its operational efficiency. The model should illustrate the flow of information and materials between processes and their temporal sequences. Create a List of all Components and Relationships for the following Scenario:

Scenario version 1: minimal
Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. The problem that hinders reaching this goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high.  
In the company, the role of the product owner for the heat pump “Smart-Heat” is responsible for the product innovation process and also has the responsibility for reaching the goal of the most energy-efficient heating solution. The product owner is part of the product development department.
The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process.
The technical components supporting the product innovation process are the production system and the version management system. The version management system supports the production system.
The “Smart-Heat” product consists of two components: the indoor module and the outdoor module. Smart-Heat has the feature of being energy-efficient.
Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: is defining the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product



To create a Business Process Model (BPM) for Organization ABC, we will outline the components and relationships in the context of the scenario provided. Our BPM will illustrate the flow of information and materials between processes, defining the roles of actors, and specifying the resources used in the processes. 

### Components and Relationships

1. **Processes**
   - **Primary Processes**:
     - Product Innovation Process
   - **Sub-Processes**:
     - Target Setting
       - **Inputs**: Customer Survey
       - **Outputs**: Target Feature List
       - **Actor**: Product Owner
       - **Resources**: Production System, Version Management System
     - Define Product Specification
       - **Inputs**: Target Feature List
       - **Outputs**: Specification Document
       - **Actor**: Product Owner
       - **Resources**: Production System, Version Management System

2. **Secondary Processes**:
   - None defined in this minimal scenario.

3. **Management Processes**:
   - None defined in this minimal scenario.

4. **External Processes**:
   - Customer Survey Collection
     - **Inputs**: Customer Expectations
     - **Outputs**: Summary of Expectations
     - **Actor**: Market Research Team

5. **Actors**:
   - Product Owner (Responsible for product innovation, target setting, and defining product specifications)
   - Market Research Team (Gathers customer expectations)

6. **Resources**:
   - Production System (Supports the product innovation process)
   - Version Management System (Supports the production system)

7. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Customer Survey → Target Setting (Input for Target Setting, Output from Market Research)
   - Target Feature List → Define Product Specification (Output from Target Setting, Input for Define Product Specification)
   - Target Feature List → Specification Document (Output from Define Product Specification)

8. **Control Flows**:
   - Sequence from Customer Survey to Target Setting (AND Connector)
   - Sequence from Target Setting to Define Product Specification (AND Connector)
   - Sequence from Define Product Specification to Specification Document (AND Connector)

9. **Flow Relationships**:
   - Customer Survey → Target Feature List (indicates the flow of information)
   - Target Feature List → Specification Document (indicates the flow of information)
   - Version Management System supports Production System (indicates dependency)

### Visual BPM Representation (Textual Outline)

- **Start**
  - Customer Survey Collection (External Process)
    - ↓ (Flow of information)
  - **Target Setting (Primary Process)**
    - Actor: Product Owner
    - Input: Customer Survey
    - Output: Target Feature List
    - Resource: Production System, Version Management System
    - ↓ (Flow of information)
  - **Define Product Specification (Primary Process)**
    - Actor: Product Owner
    - Input: Target Feature List
    - Output: Specification Document
    - Resource: Production System, Version Management System
    - ↓ (Flow of information)
- **End**

This BPM captures the essence of Organization ABC's product innovation process, detailing inputs, outputs, processes, actors, and their relationships. The focus is on streamlining operational efficiency by clearly defining elements and improving communication within the process. Such clarity will enable the organization to target its goal of creating the most energy-efficient heating solution effectively.
