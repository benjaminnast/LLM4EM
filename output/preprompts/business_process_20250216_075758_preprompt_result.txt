I am trying to capture the business processes of a Organization using a Business Process Model as follows: it includes concepts of "Primary Processes", "Secondary Processes", "Management Processes", and "External Processes". Each process involves "Inputs" and "Outputs", with responsibilities assigned to "Actors" and resources identified as "Resources". Processes are sequenced using "Control Flows", which can be connected using "AND Connectors " and "OR Connectors ". Flow relationships indicate the movement of information or materials between processes.Produce a BPM for Organization ABC that aims to streamline its operational efficiency. The model should illustrate the flow of information and materials between processes and their temporal sequences. Create a List of all Components and Relationships for the following Scenario:

Scenario version 1: minimal
Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. The problem that hinders reaching this goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high.  
In the company, the role of the product owner for the heat pump “Smart-Heat” is responsible for the product innovation process and also has the responsibility for reaching the goal of the most energy-efficient heating solution. The product owner is part of the product development department.
The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process.
The technical components supporting the product innovation process are the production system and the version management system. The version management system supports the production system.
The “Smart-Heat” product consists of two components: the indoor module and the outdoor module. Smart-Heat has the feature of being energy-efficient.
Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: is defining the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product



Here’s a Business Process Model (BPM) for Organization ABC, specifically for their product innovation process related to the "Smart-Heat" heat pump, along with a detailed list of all components and relationships. This model aims to capture and visualize the flow of information and materials between processes, ensuring the efficiency of operations.

### Business Process Model Components and Relationships

#### Components:

1. **Primary Processes:**
   - Product Innovation Process

2. **Sub-Processes:**
   - Target Setting
   - Define Product Specification

3. **Inputs:**
   - Customer Survey
   - Target Feature List

4. **Outputs:**
   - List of Target Features
   - Specification Document

5. **Actors:**
   - Product Owner (Responsible for both target setting and product specification)

6. **Resources:**
   - Production System (Supports the manufacturing of the Smart-Heat product)
   - Version Management System (Supports the production system)

7. **Control Flows:**
   - From Customer Survey → Target Setting
   - From Target Setting → List of Target Features
   - From List of Target Features → Define Product Specification
   - From Define Product Specification → Specification Document

8. **Connectors:**
   - AND Connector (indicating both "Target Setting" and "Define Product Specification" need to occur sequentially)
   - OR Connector (not explicitly mentioned in this scenario but can be included if future iterations allowed for either "Feature Updates" or "Redesign" paths)

9. **Flow Relationships:**
   - The flow relationships indicate the movement of information:
     - Customer Survey → List of Target Features (input-output relationship)
     - List of Target Features → Specification Document (input-output relationship)

#### Relationships:

1. **Target Setting**
   - **Input:** Customer Survey 
   - **Output:** List of Target Features 
   - **Actor:** Product Owner 
   - **Resource:** Version Management System 
   - **Flow Relationship:** Control Flow (sequential)

2. **Define Product Specification**
   - **Input:** List of Target Features 
   - **Output:** Specification Document
   - **Actor:** Product Owner 
   - **Resource:** Production System 
   - **Flow Relationship:** Control Flow (sequential)

3. **Overall Process Flow:**
   - Control Flow from **Customer Survey** to **Target Setting** (starts the process)
   - Control Flow from **Target Setting** to **List of Target Features**
   - Control Flow from **List of Target Features** to **Define Product Specification**
   - Control Flow from **Define Product Specification** to **Specification Document**

### Visual Representation (Text-Based)

```
[Customer Survey] ---> (Target Setting) ---> [List of Target Features]
                                 |
                                 |
                                 V
                      (Define Product Specification) ---> [Specification Document]
```

### Interpretation of Key Concepts:
- **Energy-efficiency:** The process aims to achieve a higher energy-efficiency rating through the introduction of new target features derived from customer feedback.
- **Energy Consumption:** Reviewed during the specification phase to ensure new features lead to reduced energy consumption.
- **Feature & Target Feature:** These terms facilitate the understanding of customer expectations and the functional outline necessary for the development process.

### Conclusion
This BPM is tailored to enhance operational efficiency by emphasizing the systematic flow of processes, ensuring that each step is aligned with the organization's goal of improving the energy efficiency of the Smart-Heat product. The defined components and relationships capture the essential elements necessary for effective product innovation within the organization.
