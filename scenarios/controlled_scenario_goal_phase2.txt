Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. This high-level goal can be divided into two sub-goals: sub-goal 1 is to minimize the energy consumption of the heat pump, and sub-goal 2 is to produce the remaining energy required by the heat pump with the integrated photovoltaic module. The problem that hinders reaching the high-level goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high.
