Our company MultiHeat develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. The problem that hinders reaching the high-level goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high. This high-level goal can be divided into three sub-goals: sub-goal 1 is to minimize the energy consumption of the heat pump, sub-goal 2 is to produce the remaining energy required by the heat pump with the integrated photovoltaic module, and sub-goal 3 is to provide services supporting high availability of the heat pump. There is a constraint related to sub-goal 2: the maximum energy production of the photovoltaic module is 50 kWh. Sub-goal 1 also can be refined into two sub-goals: sub-goal 11 is to develop a new heat extractor with very low energy consumption, and sub-goal 12 is to re-design the existing heat extractor by adapting it for a new refrigerant. Sub-goal 11 and sub-goal 12 are alternate sub-goals, i.e., only one of them has to be reached to reach sub-goal 1. The problem that hinders sub-goal 11 is the short period available for the development and the problem that hinders sub-goal 12 is that new refrigerants are very expensive. The problems that hinder sub-goal 3 are that the control unit has to be connected to the Internet to provide the status information required for the service and that the company does not have much experience with online information processing. The opportunity connected to sub-goal 3 is a new European regulation for energy-efficient heating that requires continuous monitoring of devices.
