The product innovation process uses two IT-systems: the production system and the version management system. The production system is the most important one. The version management system supports the production system. The production system consists of three components: the database system, the transaction middleware and the user interface. The IT system used in the marketing campaign is the social media studio, which consists of the SM authoring system and the SM life system. Both share the SM repository.
