Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The company has the goal to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. To achieve this, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of the heat pump and to produce the remaining energy required by the heat pump with the integrated photovoltaic module. But the energy consumption of the current product version is too high. We have to solve this problem.
