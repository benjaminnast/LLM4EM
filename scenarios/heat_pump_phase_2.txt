Our company develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. This high-level goal can be divided into two sub-goals: sub-goal 1 is to minimize the energy consumption of the heat pump, and sub-goal 2 is to produce the remaining energy required by the heat pump with the integrated photovoltaic module. The problem that hinders reaching the high-level goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high.
In the company, the role of the product owner for the heat pump “Smart-Heat” is responsible for the product innovation process and also has the responsibility to reach the goal of the most energy-efficient heating solution. The product owner works in the product development department, an organisational unit of the company. The role of product designer also works in the product development department, which is another organizational unit of the company. The product designer is responsible for the sub-goal of minimizing the energy consumption of the heat pump.
The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output, which is the input for the next sub-process “product design”. This sub-process has the design description as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process. The product designer performs the product design sub-process.
The technical components supporting the product innovation process are the production system and the version management system. The version management system supports the production system. The production system consists of three components: the database system, the transaction middleware and the user interface component.
The “Smart-Heat” product is a heat pump that consists of two components: the indoor module and the outdoor module. The outdoor module also consists of two modules: the photovoltaic module and the outdoor air exchange unit. Smart-Heat has the feature of being energy-efficient. The photovoltaic module has the feature of zero-emission energy production.
Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: defines the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product
    • Design description: defines the main building blocks of a product, their interfaces and dependencies.
    • Zero-emission energy production: means that energy is produced without causing CO2 emissions
    • Heat pump: extracts heat from water or the air, amplifies it and provides it to heat buildings.
Some of the above concepts are attributes of the heat pump concept: energy-efficiency, energy consumption and a list of features.
