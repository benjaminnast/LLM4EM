The marketing campaign process can be decomposed into four processes: plan marketing campaign, run social media campaign, run print media campaign and supervise campaign results. “Plan marketing campaign” receives the campaign target document as input information and produces the campaign plan as output. What follows are two processes in parallel, which means that there is a split into two processes: “run social media campaign” and “run print media campaign”. Both receive the campaign plan as input and produce the campaign statistics as output. After the completion of both processes, the process “supervise campaign results” follows and produces the campaign result document as output. The marketing department is responsible for all four processes that are part of the marketing campaign process.
