When one of MultiHeat’s customers submits an order, the first process with the company to receive the order specification is check order validity. This process either rejects the customer order or produces a verified order specification, which is the input to the next step, the handling of the customer order. This process produces the order confirmation that is processed in the next step, prepare product delivery, that results in a delivery order. Handle customer order consists of three steps that can be done in parallel: check availability of the ordered product; check customer status (in particular, for unpaid invoices); and check configuration (what product configuration is required?). All three steps together produce the order confirmation.
