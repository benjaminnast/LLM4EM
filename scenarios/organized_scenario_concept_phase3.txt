Let me explain some of the important concepts we use in the company:
•	Energy-efficiency can be calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption. 
•	Energy consumption is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
•	The customer survey provides an overview what our customers expect for the next version of our products.
•	Feature is something the customer wants the product to have.
•	Target feature is a feature we will implement in the next version of the product
•	Specification document defines the functional and non-functional characteristics to be offered by the product
•	Design description defines the main building blocks of a product with their interfaces.
•	Zero-emission energy production means that energy is produced without CO2 emissions
•	Heat pump extracts heat from the environment to be used to heat buildings. Heat pumps are characterized by their energy-efficiency, energy consumption and features.
•	Campaign target document defines the target group, campaign start and end date, and the campaign budget.
•	Campaign plan describes what social media activities and print media products are part of the campaign.
•	Campaign statistics summarizes the response rates for the social media and print media activities.
