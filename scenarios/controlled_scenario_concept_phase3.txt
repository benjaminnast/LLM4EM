Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products

    • Zero-emission energy production: means that energy is produced without causing CO2 emissions
    • Heat pump: extracts heat from water or the air, amplifies it and provides it to heat buildings. Some of the above concepts are attributes of the heat pump concept: energy-efficiency, energy consumption and a list of features.
    • Campaign target document: consists of the attributes target group, campaign start date, campaign end date and campaign budget.
