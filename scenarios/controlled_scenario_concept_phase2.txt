Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: defines the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product
    • Design description: defines the main building blocks of a product, their interfaces and dependencies.
    • Zero-emission energy production: means that energy is produced without causing CO2 emissions
    • Heat pump: extracts heat from water or the air, amplifies it and provides it to heat buildings.
Some of the above concepts are attributes of the heat pump concept: energy-efficiency, energy consumption and a list of features.
