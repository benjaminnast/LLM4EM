The process of a marketing campaign consists of four steps: it starts with planning the marketing campaign. This step takes a document describing the campaign target as input and develops the campaign plan. Afterwards, two steps happen in parallel: the social media campaign and the print media campaign. Both are based on the campaign plan and both deliver some statistics about the campaign. The last step is the supervision of the campaign results that produces a result document. The marketing department is responsible for steps of this process.
