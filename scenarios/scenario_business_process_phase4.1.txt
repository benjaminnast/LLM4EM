The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output, which is the input for the next sub-process “product design”. This sub-process has the design description as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process. The product designer performs the product design sub-process.
