Our company MultiHeat develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The goal of the company is to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. The problem that hinders reaching the high-level goal is that the energy consumption of the current product version is too high. This high-level goal can be divided into three sub-goals: sub-goal 1 is to minimize the energy consumption of the heat pump, sub-goal 2 is to produce the remaining energy required by the heat pump with the integrated photovoltaic module, and sub-goal 3 is to provide services supporting high availability of the heat pump. There is a constraint related to sub-goal 2: the maximum energy production of the photovoltaic module is 50 kWh. Sub-goal 1 also can be refined into two sub-goals: sub-goal 11 is to develop a new heat extractor with very low energy consumption, and sub-goal 12 is to re-design the existing heat extractor by adapting it for a new refrigerant. Sub-goal 11 and sub-goal 12 are alternate sub-goals, i.e., only one of them has to be reached to reach sub-goal 1. The problem that hinders sub-goal 11 is the short period available for the development and the problem that hinders sub-goal 12 is that new refrigerants are very expensive. The problems that hinder sub-goal 3 are that the control unit has to be connected to the Internet to provide the status information required for the service and that the company does not have much experience with online information processing. The opportunity connected to sub-goal 3 is a new European regulation for energy-efficient heating that requires continuous monitoring of devices.
In the company, the role of the product owner for the heat pump “Smart-Heat” is responsible for the product innovation process and also has the responsibility to reach the goal of the most energy-efficient heating solution. The product owner works in the product development department, an organisational unit of MultiHeat. The role of product designer also works in the product development department, which is another organizational unit of MultiHeat. The product designer is responsible for the sub-goal of minimizing the energy consumption of the heat pump. MultiHeat has three more organizational units: the marketing department, the social media group, and the print media group. The print media group and the social media group are both part of the marketing department. The printing press is a resource of the MultiHeat that belongs to the print media department. The role of print designer works in the print media group and is responsible for the process “run print media campaign”. The role of printing press operator also works in the print media group and operates the printing press. The role of social media designer works in the social media group and is responsible for the process “run social media campaign”. The role of content specialist also works in the social media group. The role of the general manager manages the company MultiHeat. All departments mentioned are part of the company.
The product innovation process starts with the sub-process of target setting, which receives the customer survey as input information and produces the list of target features as output information. The target feature list is the input for the next sub-process, which is to define the product specification. This sub-process has the specification document as output, which is the input for the next sub-process “product design”. This sub-process has the design description as output and is the last step in the innovation process. The product owner performs the target setting and the product specification sub-process. The product designer performs the product design sub-process.

Business Process Modell
The marketing campaign process can be decomposed into four processes: plan marketing campaign, run social media campaign, run print media campaign and supervise campaign results. “Plan marketing campaign” receives the campaign target document as input information and produces the campaign plan as output. What follows are two processes in parallel, which means that there is a split into two processes: “run social media campaign” and “run print media campaign”. Both receive the campaign plan as input and produce the campaign statistics as output. After the completion of both processes, the process “supervise campaign results” follows and produces the campaign result document as output. The marketing department is responsible for all four processes that are part of the marketing campaign process.

Business Process Modell
“Submit customer order” is an external process that results in an order specification. The order specification is the input to the process “check order validity”. This process either produces the output “verified order specification”, which is the input to the process “handle customer order”, or the output “rejected order specification”, which is the input to the process “reject customer order”. “Handle customer order” produces the output “order confirmation” that is the input to “prepare product delivery”. The “handle customer order” process can be decomposed into three sub-processes that all run in parallel: the first sub-process is “check availability”; the second sub-process is ”check customer status” and the third sub-process is “check configuration”. All sub-processes together produce the output “order confirmation.
The technical components supporting the product innovation process are the production system and the version management system. The version management system supports the production system. The production system consists of three components: the database system, the transaction middleware and the user interface component. Technical components supporting the marketing campaign process are the social media studio, which consists of two components: the SM authoring system and the SM life system. SM authoring and SM life system share an additional component: the SM repository. Technical components supporting the handle customer order process are the product planning system and the enterprise resource planning system. Both systems share an additional component: the distributed database.
The “Smart-Heat” product is a heat pump that consists of two components: the indoor module and the outdoor module. The outdoor module also consists of two modules: the photovoltaic module and the outdoor air exchange unit. Smart-Heat has the feature of being energy-efficient. The photovoltaic module has the feature of zero-emission energy production. In addition to Smart-Heat, the company also offers a service product called “maintenance and trouble-shooting”. This product consists of the service modules “annual service” and “repair”, and of the product “service kit”. The features of “maintenance and trouble-shooting” are quick response to error situations, discount prices in case of repairs and personal service technician.
Important concepts we have to understand are
    • Energy-efficiency: is calculated as the energy output for heating divided by the energy consumption
    • Energy consumption: is measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh) per year
    • Customer survey: summarizes what expectations the customers have regarding the next version of the company products
    • Feature: is a characteristic of the product visible for the customer
    • Target feature: is a feature to be implemented in the next version of the product
    • Specification document: defines the functional and non-functional characteristics to be achieved by a product
    • Design description: defines the main building blocks of a product, their interfaces and dependencies.
    • Zero-emission energy production: means that energy is produced without causing CO2 emissions
    • Heat pump: extracts heat from water or the air, amplifies it and provides it to heat buildings. Some of the above concepts are attributes of the heat pump concept: energy-efficiency, energy consumption and a list of features.
    • Campaign target document: consists of the attributes target group, campaign start date, campaign end date and campaign budget.
    • Campaign plan: describes what social media activities and print media products are part of the campaign.
    • Campaign statistics: summarizes the response rates for the social media and print media activities.
    • Campaign result document: summarizes the statistics and compares them with the attributes in the campaign target document.
    • Order specification: provides all information relevant for a customer order. The order specification has the attributes customer name, customer id, order date, desired delivery date, list of ordered products.
    • Rejected order specification: is the order specification with an additional attribute describing the reason for the rejection.
    • Verified order specification: is the order specification with an additional attribute documenting who accepted the order.
    • Order confirmation: consists of the verified order specification and the delivery order.
    • Delivery order: specifies when and where the ordered products are prepared for delivery to the customer.
