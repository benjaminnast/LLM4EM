Our company MultiHeat develops and manufactures heat pumps for family homes. The company has the goal to provide the most energy-efficient heating solution on the market. To achieve this, we aim to minimize the energy consumption of the heat pump and to produce the remaining energy required by the heat pump with the integrated photovoltaic module. But the energy consumption of the current product version is too high. We have to solve this problem. To minimize the energy consumption, we aim to either develop a new heat extractor with very low energy consumption, or to re-design the existing heat extractor by adapting it for a new refrigerant. However, the period available for the development is very short, and new refrigerants are very expensive. These two problems have to be addressed. There is also a constraint related to producing the remaining energy for the heat pump with photovoltaic: the maximum energy production of the photovoltaic module is 50 kWh.
