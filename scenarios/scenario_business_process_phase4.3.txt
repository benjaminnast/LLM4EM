“Submit customer order” is an external process that results in an order specification. The order specification is the input to the process “check order validity”. This process either produces the output “verified order specification”, which is the input to the process “handle customer order”, or the output “rejected order specification”, which is the input to the process “reject customer order”. “Handle customer order” produces the output “order confirmation” that is the input to “prepare product delivery”. The “handle customer order” process can be decomposed into three sub-processes that all run in parallel: the first sub-process is “check availability”; the second sub-process is ”check customer status” and the third sub-process is “check configuration”. All sub-processes together produce the output “order confirmation”. “Prepare product delivery” has the output “delivery order”.
