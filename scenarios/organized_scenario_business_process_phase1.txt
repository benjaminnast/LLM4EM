The first step in the product innovation process is target setting. In target setting, we need the customer survey as input and use it to develop the list of target features. The next step is to define the product specification based on the target feature list. The result is the specification document and concludes the innovation process. As the product owner, I am responsible for both steps, target setting and product specification.
